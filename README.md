## Instructor: [Kezz Bracey][instructor url]


If you're used to developing with web technologies, it's hard to go back to developing with OS-specific languages and APIs. What's worse, if you want to develop for multiple desktop platforms, you might need to use completely different language for each version of your software. Well, no you don't have to! 

Creating desktop apps is now easier than ever before. NW.js gives you the ability to take any web app and turn it into a desktop app with just a few steps. You can keep using the web languages and work flows that you're used to, while still delivering a desktop native experience to your users. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Kezz Bracey will teach you how to take an existing web-based task manager app, and turn it into a Mac desktop app using NW.js.
